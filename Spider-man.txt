Starring one of the world’s most iconic Super Heroes, Marvel's Spider-Man features the acrobatic abilities,
 improvisation and web-slinging that the wall-crawler is famous for, while also introducing elements never-before-seen
 in a Spider-Man game. Mix and match a varied set of evolved combat mechanics, including melee, aerial combat, webs,
 stealth, and unique high-tech gadgets that highlight Spider-Man’s boundless acrobatic agility and active combat style.
 Sony Interactive Entertainment, Insomniac Games, and Marvel have teamed up to create a brand-new and authentic
 Spider-Man adventure. This isn’t the Spider-Man you’ve met or ever seen before. After eight years behind the mask,
 Peter Parker is more experienced, confident, and masterful with his dynamic powers and abilities than ever before.
 However, balancing his dual life as Spider-Man proves difficult as he struggles with his own personal responsibilities
 and relationships while knowing that the safety and fate of New York City rests upon his shoulders.
